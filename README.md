### Overview 
Refactoring a working site to streamline code

### Explanation of task
I have learned that every good developer needs to know how to write semantic code as well as be able to refactor an already existing code. To that end I have taken a working site that previously used non-semantic tags and I have refactored it to use semantic tags.  The overall functionality of the site has remained the same. 

### Benefit of refactoring
The original code was very well written but it contained only non-semantic tags. I have refactored the code so that it is easier to decipher at a glance.  The semantic tags give far more information and detail at a glance than a simple div or span tag.  

### Personal benefit from refactoring
Prior to this exercise I was only really familiar with non-semantic tags.  By completing this task I have become far more familiar with how to write clear and concise code. In the future I would like to revisit this code and expand upon it as my knowledge level increases.
